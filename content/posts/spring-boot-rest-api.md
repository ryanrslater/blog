# Setting up the Spring Boot project

The goal of this is to build out a rest API using Spring Boot, Postgres and Docker with a CI/CD process.
The project I will be building may evolve substantially over time but I will try and keep a GitHub branch live where you can view this code.
My project will be site where Hospitality suppliers can upload current deals and offers they have and local venues can buy them directly on the site.

## Spring dependencies
