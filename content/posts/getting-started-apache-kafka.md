Download and Install Apache Kafka
You can download Apache Kafka from the official Apache Kafka website (https://kafka.apache.org/downloads). Once you have downloaded the binaries, you can extract the files to a directory on your machine.

```
./bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

Once the Zookeeper service is up and running, you can start the Kafka service by executing the following command:

```
./bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
